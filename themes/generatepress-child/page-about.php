            <br/>

            <p class="about-blockTwo-bodyText">Our teachers believe that children learn through play, with structured learning moments. Our Teachers plan their curriculum within a caring and creative environment. Our programs are carefully designed to enlarge the child’s knowledge and skill, to increase self-confidence, and to promote curiosity and initiative.</p>

            <br/>

            <p class="about-blockTwo-bodyText">Our teachers are well trained and have a love for children. They have knowledge of what is developmentally appropriate for our children. Our staff receives initial training to the program upon employment and this training is on-going. Each teacher attends a minimum of 15 clock hours of training per year. In addition, each teacher is required to attend the Infant/Child CPR and 1St Aid Training and renew training every year. In-service training is conducted monthly at staff meetings. Our teachers are aware that this training is important to enable them to have current information for our children.</p>
